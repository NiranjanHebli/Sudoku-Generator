## How to Deploy On Google Cloud?

First step, you have to enable App Engine Admin API in your Project,After enabling the API go to Cloud Shell and write the Command:
 ```
 gcloud app create
 
 ```

Second step,open the Text Editor and create a new directory www and add the project folders and files in it.In the root directory create a file deploy.yaml add the following code in it:
```
runtime: python27                             
api_version: 1                                  
threadsafe: true                      

handlers:                      
\- url: /                      
  static_files: www/index.html                              
  upload: www/index.html                               
   
\- url: /(.*)                       
  static_files: www/\1
  upload: www/(.*)
  
 ```
Third step,run the following commands:

```
gcloud app deploy deploy.yaml                              

gcloud app browse

```
